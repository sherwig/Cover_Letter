      <h2>Hi my name is Sam Herwig and I am a Creative Technologist Mountain Man. </h2>
      <p>This means I love coding and creating while also pursuing my outdoor interests which includes getting extremely scared on very steep cliffs, avoiding avalanches, and
        chasing my dad up hills on the mountain bike, which I have never beaten him to the top of. (picture of adventuring)</p>

      <h2>I want to tell you a story about my master’s thesis.</h2>
      <p> I went to my outside advisor with the idea of creating a particle system that was consistently changing on the web. He looked me straight in the eyes and said you need to get going on this right now. This was two weeks before the semester
        even started. (gif of get going)

      <h2>So I put my head down and dove head first into the rabbit hole.</h2>
      <p>Little did I know that this rabbit hole is in fact endless. The first step was to learn GLSL, and the second was to spend the rest of my life learning GLSL. I watched tutorial after tutorial and actually created some interesting results.
        Here check it out: (video of some prototypes)

      <h2>Next came the untamed beast, THREE.js</h2>
      <p>I have a lot of experience with creative coding platforms, but THREE.js is more difficult because it is meant for the web so it is to be used by anyone with an internet connection. This means it needs to be closer to base openGL, which adds
        a lot of complexity.
      </p>

      <h2>First step, display the shaders within THREE.js.</h2>
      <h3>Okay no idea how to do that.</h3>
      <p>Google, message professor on Slack. Professor is a very busy man. Start Webpack tutorials. Understand how to import modules and files. Wow this is way cooler than including them in the HTML. Okay now I can get the shaders to interact with
        the Javascript, but how do I write GLSL again. Google. Oh yeah go back to code from a week ago and learn to apply in THREE. Watch, learn, absorb, apply. (Show some things I made in THREE)

      <h2>At this point they have bolted my window shut like Harry Potter so I can’t throw my computer out of it.</h2>
      <p>I always persevered to create something that I was proud of. From this I have gone down a lot of development rabbit holes. These rabbit holes have made me a diverse and experienced coder. I wanted this short story to show you a little bit
        about how I think. I take on big lofty projects and struggle through them with a smile on my face.

      <h2>From these projects I am confident in my ability to learn any new technology to help your team. </h2>
      <p>Additionally, I will never shy away from a challenge as they invigorate me and I get excited with the prospect of learning. I will bring a joyous attitude to your team that knows when and how to get the work done. I have strong communication
        skills and will be able to work and fit into any team.
